  - Saffron|ust like that, I return to life! How easy it is to forget the qualities
    of the living world!
  - Saffron|The colors are just as dark and dreary, the smells as stuffed with dust,
    the passing trees as tangled as they were before, and yet I witness them with
    the wonder of a worm!
  - SaffronTell me, Mrs. Crow, how does it feel?
  - Mrs. Crow|How does what feel, little Saffron?
  - "Saffron|I\u2019m so very curious, beloved caretaker, how it must feel to possess
    power over life and death! How does it feel to be a god? A true divine? "
  - Mrs. Crow|You were not dead, and I am most certainly not a divine.
  - "Saffron|You\u2019re no fun, ma\u2019am\u2026"
  - Mrs. Crow|Come, dove, would you tell me what had frightened you so? The entire
    train is out of sorts.
  - "Saffron|Oh, she is a mighty beast. Your beau has a handle on it, last I heard.
    My, my, the shaking and the shouting! She is like to crawl on the roof and snatch
    my unliving soul from my very carapace\u2026!"
  - "Mrs. Crow|\u201CHas a handle on it,\u201D has he\u2026?"
  - 'Saffron|My, Mrs. Crow, is that a shade of betrayal I hear in your voice? '
