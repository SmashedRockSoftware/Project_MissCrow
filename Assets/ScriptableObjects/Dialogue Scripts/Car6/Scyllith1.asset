  - "Scyllith|Then there is no piercing the veil? Surely the Dust Mystics have one
    among their number\u2026"
  - Mr. Crow|No, mighty Scyllith. Many Shadows before you have, in rage or in grief,
    sought their council. They can certainly help you heal. But none can help you
    pass the veil.
  - "Scyllith|It\u2019s not fair. There is no justice in this. Where is the balance?
    Are you content with these foul laws?"
  - Scyllith|I... I had only just earned my title. Had just passed my trials. And
    I am expected to let it go, because someone got bored.
  - Mrs. Crow|Miss Scyllith, would you care for a bit of tea while you talk?
