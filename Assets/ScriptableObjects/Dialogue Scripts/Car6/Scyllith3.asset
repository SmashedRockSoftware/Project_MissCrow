  - Mrs. Crow|Rats and drats!
  - "Mr. Crow|She is a real challenge, isn\u2019t she?"
  - "Mrs. Crow|Why did you send me back? You know good and well I don\u2019t need
    you magicking me to and fro!"
  - 'Mr. Crow|I acted in haste. The way she appeared aboard badly startled me. '
  - "Mrs. Crow|She was furious, that\u2019s true\u2026 Poor dear died witnessing
    a massacre, it sounds like. Maybe you were right to teleport me, anyway! It looks
    like I have made quite a mess of things. Talking them through was never my strong
    suit."
  - Mr. Crow|Blackbird of my heart, do you know why we work together so well?
  - "Mrs. Crow|Grumble grumble\u2026 What is it you say? That I heal their hearts
    and you soothe their souls?"

  - Mrs. Crow|You are too good with words, Mr. Crow.
  - "Mr. Crow|And you know just what everyone needs. I am very sorry I teleported
    you away. I shouldn\u2019t have done that."
  - "Mrs. Crow|You old bird. I can\u2019t stay cross with you for long. Say\u2026
    I have an idea. Are you in the mood for a little bit of tea?"
  - Mr. Crow|Oh, that is smart!
