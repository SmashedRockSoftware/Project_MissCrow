  - Scyllith|A burden is lifted.
  - Mrs. Crow|If you wish to leave the train, it's best to go around without a great
    big sword through your heart.
  - Scyllith|I do not understand. I spurned your help, yet you ease my turmoil.
  - "Mrs. Crow|It\u2019s what we do, Shadow. The living world is filled with injustice,
    but this place, this land which straddles True Death, is for healing, for meditation\u2026
    and for talking. But if you aren\u2019t ready, you aren\u2019t ready. That\u2019s
    that!"
  - "Scyllith|When I leave\u2026 I\u2019ll be back here eventually, won\u2019t I?"
  - "Mrs. Crow|Yes, Miss Scyllith. That\u2019s the way of it."
  - "Scyllith|Then so be it. I\u2019ll seek answers, I\u2019ll seek justice, and
    when all is truly at an end\u2026"
  - "Mrs. Crow|We\u2019ll be waiting. Only when you\u2019re ready, beautiful Shadow. "
  - Mr. Crow|Well said, Mrs. Crow!
