  - "Scyllith|Then there is no piercing the veil? Surely the Dust Mystics have one
    among their number\u2026"
  - Mr. Crow|No, mighty Scyllith. Many Shadows before you have, in rage or in grief,
    sought their council. They can certainly help you heal. But none can help you
    pass the veil.
  - "Scyllith|It\u2019s not fair. There is no justice in this. Where is the balance?
    Are you content with these foul laws?"
  - Scyllith|I... I had only just earned my title. Had just passed my trials. And
    I am expected to let it go, because someone got bored.
  - Mrs. Crow|Miss Scyllith, would you care for a bit of tea while you talk?
  - 
  - Scyllith|I am not here to sip tea, Shadow Shepherd. You will not presume to speak
    to me.
  - Mrs. Crow|Now, our Chef Tin makes the best Spider Tea. I can set it down and
    you can drink it when-
  - Scyllith|I am the mighty Scyllith, princess of the great Kharitbr House. I will
    not be condescended to!
  - 
  - Mrs. Crow|Rats and drats!
  - "Mr. Crow|She is a real challenge, isn\u2019t she?"
  - "Mrs. Crow|Why did you send me back? You know good and well I don\u2019t need
    you magicking me to and fro!"
  - 'Mr. Crow|I acted in haste. The way she appeared aboard badly startled me. '
  - "Mrs. Crow|She was furious, that\u2019s true\u2026 Poor dear died witnessing
    a massacre, it sounds like. Maybe you were right to teleport me, anyway! It looks
    like I have made quite a mess of things. Talking them through was never my strong
    suit."
  - Mr. Crow|Blackbird of my heart, do you know why we work together so well?
  - "Mrs. Crow|Grumble grumble\u2026 What is it you say? That I heal their hearts
    and you soothe their souls?"
  - Mr. Crow|How is it your fault that we got a new passenger with a perfectly full
    heart and a deeply wounded soul?
  - Mrs. Crow|You are too good with words, Mr. Crow.
  - "Mr. Crow|And you know just what everyone needs. I am very sorry I teleported
    you away. I shouldn\u2019t have done that."
  - "Mrs. Crow|You old bird. I can\u2019t stay cross with you for long. Say\u2026
    I have an idea. Are you in the mood for a little bit of tea?"
  - Mr. Crow|Oh, that is smart!
